# cv09_via_json
Json to be used to configure CV09 9 keys VIA/QMK enabled macropad from Aliexpress with usevia.app 

The device was obtained from Aliexpress. It has the following description 'CV09 Custom DIY 9Key Mini Keyboard QMK Firmware Layout Prog Rammable VIA Key Hot Plug Kit Customize RGB Macro Keys Keyboards'.

It's based on CH552G microcontroller and the internet is unaware of QMK enabled firmwares for this chip. 

Json to configre the item with usevia.app was obtained from another seller, not the one I've bought the item from. So I think it's worth sharing. Some descriptions for custom functions are in Chinese. The json is to be loaded at the 'Design' tab, that can be enabled in 'Settings'.

The device has only 2 layers and 51 bytes for macros. Layers are enabled with Keys found in 'Custom' tab, not in 'Layers' tab.

Don't know if it can be reflashed with FAK firmware, but VIA has separate tab titled 'upgrade'.
